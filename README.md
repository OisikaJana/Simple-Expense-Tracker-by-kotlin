# Simple-Expense-Tracker-by-kotlin
 Create an app that helps users track their daily expenses. They can add new expenses, categorize them (e.g., food, transport, entertainment), and view a summary of expenses by category.

# How to run :

Step 1: 
    Set Up an Android Project 
    Open Android Studio.
    Select "New Project" > "Empty Activity".
    Name your project, select Kotlin as the language, and click Finish.

Step 2:
    Add the XML Layout
    In Android Studio, go to the res/layout folder, and open activity_main.xml.
    Replace the content of activity_main.xml with the code I provided earlier.

Step 3:
    Write the Kotlin Code
    Go to MainActivity.kt in the java folder.
    Replace the content of MainActivity.kt with the following code:

Step 4: 
    Run the App on an Emulator or Device
    Connect an Android device via USB or start an emulator.
    Click Run > Run 'app' in Android Studio, or press the green play button in the toolbar.
    The app will launch on the connected device/emulator, showing the UI you created in XML.

# How to Use the App

       field, then click "Add Expense".
   ii. View Summary: Click "View Summary" to see a summary of all expenses grouped by category in a ListView.
  iii. Thatâ€™s it! You now have a simple Android Expense Tracker app that runs on your device or emulator.
